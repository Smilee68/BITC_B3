    <h1>The legend trilogy: Dark knight </h1>
    <h2 id="cite"> A serie by Christopher Nolan</h2>

            Batman Begins set the standard, The Dark Knight raised the bar, and The Dark Knight Rises completed The Dark Knight Trilogy, a psychological, epic Christopher Nolan franchise.
            Looking back at the three films in The Dark Knight Trilogy, it’s hard to argue that they aren’t the best superhero movies to date. Nothing has come close.
            <br>In 1997, after three fairly successful films (two from Tim Burton), the Batman saga came to a complete halt, due to the critically reviled Batman & Robin. The Joel Schumacher directed film, which features George Clooney in a nipple bat-suit, has a legacy among comic book fans as one of the worst movies ever. 
            “I think we might have killed the franchise,” Clooney later confessed vowing to never reprise the role. Although Warner Bros. had plans to produce another Schumacher Batman, either Batman: Year One or Batman Beyond, the suits eventually came to their senses and employed up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) to reboot the series.

        <h2>Batman Begins</h2>
        <img src="batman 1.jpeg" alt="pic1" id="pic1">
        <p>
            In 2005, Batman Begins (the first film in the trilogy) was born, reintroducing audiences to a “more realistic” Batman / Bruce Wayne. With the first film, Christopher Nolan changed the game, adding deeper, frightening and more thoughtful aspects to a genre that was considered to be nothing more than popcorn flicks. This wasn’t just another comic-book movie. <br>Batman Begins, a radically new interpretation, instead offered profound themes on humanity, justice, revenge, honour, heroism, integrity and fear. Influenced by Frank Miller’s Dark Knight Returns comics, the action film challenged audiences and questioned public morale while reintroducing us to the origins of the Batman legend. This was a Gotham City the audience had never seen in a comic book movie before; gritty, bleak and unjust.
            “They told me there was nothing out there, nothing to fear. But the night my parents were murdered I caught a glimpse of something. I’ve looked for it ever since. I went around the world, searched in all the shadows. And there is something out there in the darkness, something terrifying, something that will not stop until it gets revenge… Me.” – Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)
            <br>Batman Begins (84% on Rotten Tomatoes) is the heartbreaking journey of Bruce Wayne and the rise of a vengeful vigilante named Batman. Writers Nolan and David S. Goyer crafted a script that based Batman in a very similar universe to our own. For the first time, we were allowed to witness the true effects of the tragedy that befell a young Bruce. And so Batman Begins became the template for comic book origin stories.  
            After his parents’ deaths (killed by Joe Chill), Bruce Wayne becomes completely lost in vengeance, forsaking his riches in search of a way to fight injustice. Along his travels, he meets Ra’s Al Ghul, leader of The League of Shadows, who helps the angry youth to channel his fears. Henri Ducard trains Bruce in ancient forms of combat, but before completing his training he learns of the League’s true intentions to destroy Gotham City.
            <br>After escaping, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham to serve as its protector. He takes on the image of a Bat, believing that his very own phobia could be a symbol for justice – “My fears will become their fears.” With access to the Wayne Enterprises Applied Sciences Department (thanks to Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman), Wayne Manor tunnels and the help of a police detective, James Gordon, Batman does the impossible; taking down Gotham City’s criminal underground.

        <h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
        <p>
            Although audiences were paying attention, thanks to the success of Batman Begins, nothing could prepare us for the sensational Dark Knight (94% on Rotten Tomatoes). The sequel was bigger, darker, and better in every department. The Godfather of superhero movies, The Dark Knight raised the bar and set a new standard for comic book film

            “Look at me. So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you. Who tells me I worry too much. Who tells me I ought to smile more. Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. One day, they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can’t take it. I just want to see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don’t care about the scars. So… I stick a razor in my mouth and do this… to myself. And you know what? She can’t stand the sight of me! She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I’m always smiling!” – The Joker (Heath Ledger)
            <br>At the end of Batman Begins, Batman restores some order to Gotham City. But even though the city isn’t run by mobs and criminal organizations any longer, the justice department is still not in control of the city. Even though police now have a fighting chance, Batman still has to step in to save the day. When Bruce Wayne grows tired of being Batman, he finds a young hopeful lawyer (Gotham’s White Knight) who shares his ambitions for justice and peace in Gotham City.
            The announcement of the sequel was met with some controversy, mostly due to the casting of Heath Ledger as the Joker. But as everyone knows, Ledger not only went on to prove his worth but also won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the role of Joker. Sadly Heath never got to witness the popularity of his character and died before the release of the film or receiving his Oscar. Today his legacy continues as one of the best actors in a comic book film

        <h2>The Dark Knight: Rises</h2>
        <p>“I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew that there was nothing for you here except pain and tragedy.” – Alfred (Michael Caine)

            The Dark Knight Rises brings The Dark Knight Trilogy ‘s Batman story full circle. Plots, locations and characters from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight return, along with a long list of new characters. While the film turned out to be full of twists and surprises, it wasn’t nearly as perfect as The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan got a little sloppy with some of the editing and a storyline that includes huge plot holes. Although it wasn’t nearly a terrible movie at all, it did and didn’t quite live up to all the hype.
             With each film Nolan pushed his operatic Batman even deeper into the dark, exploring issues of fear, death, loss and suffering. The Dark Knight Rises was no exception and is ultimately the best example of the themes at work in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan, who rewrote the rule book with the dark and gritty first instalment Batman Begins, cranked it up a notch, exploring the world of terrorism. There are frightening themes at work in the film, as the two-minded “heroes” verse the multilayered “villains”. The cringing fear is echoed even louder through Zimmer’s powerful doom drumming soundtrack.
